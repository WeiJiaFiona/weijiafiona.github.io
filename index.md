# Jiawei's Academic Homepage

I am undergraduate student in the School of Biomedical Engineering at ShanghaiTech University, supervised by Prof. Zhiming Cui.

My research focuses on deep learning for medical image analysis. During my undergraduate study, I explored segmentation, generation, reconstruction, registration, and landmark detection across modalities including CT, MRI, and X-ray. I have received a national-level competition first prize and published a first-author paper in *Journal of Dentistry*.

## üîç Research Interests
- Computer-aided diagnosis: tumor segmentation, fully automated prognosis, digital twins for virtual surgical planning.
- Embedding imaging physics and pathology priors to enhance algorithm interpretability and efficiency.
